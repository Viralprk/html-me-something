							<p>I was always inspired by Budhha and wanted to make a painting 
							   that is relaxing and soothing - finally settled for this with
							   Buddha statue. It resonates calm and peace to me. I choose oil
							   paints and blending techniques.
							   One of his inspiration queotes- Educate yourself in order to be
							   a high ranking official of any entity.
							   Every master starts as a servant. Keep learning to be promoted.
							   But keep your feet always on the ground no matter what. 
							   Because the people you meet on your way up will be same people
							   you will meet on your way down. Be humble.</p>

							<p>This is one of the largest and quietest ghats on the Ganges at Varanasi.
		It is only five minute walk south from the main Dasaswamedh Ghat.
		Dominant feature here is the tall building with green style columns 
		and porches. There are also a couple of rooftop terraces.
		The building is nicely floodlit at night.</p>
